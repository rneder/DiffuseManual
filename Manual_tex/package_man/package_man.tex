\chapter{Welcome} \label{welc}

Congratulations for downloading the \Discus package. The \Discus package
consists of the following programs:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{\textsc{DISCUS SUITE}}: The \Suite is a common program
  that includes \Discus \Diffev and \kuplot. It allows to switch
  seamlessly between the individual sections and will eventually replace
  the individual parts. It also offers an optimization for large scale 
  computing facilities. For all practical reasons, the 
  \textbf{\textsc{DISCUS SUITE}} should be used and the use of the 
  individual programs DISCUS, DIFFEV and KUPLOT is discouraged.

  \item \textbf{\textsc{DISCUS}}: This is the main diffuse scattering
  and defect structure simulation program. This is the program that
  gave the package its name.
  
  \item \textbf{\textsc{DIFFEV}}: This is a more recent addition. This
  program allows the refinement of a set of high level parameters 
  (\textit{e.g.} input parameters of a \Discus macro) based on a
  differential evolutionary algorithm.
  
  \item \textbf{\textsc{MIXSCAT}}: This is newest addition to the 
  \Discus package. This program allows on to extract differential
  PDFs from neutron- and x-ray data.
  
  \item \textbf{\textsc{KUPLOT}}: This is plotting program of the
  package. It is nearly as old as \Discus itself. 
  
%  \item \textbf{\textsc{PDFFIT}}: This is a PDF refinement program.
%  It has been retired and users are encouraged to download the new
%  version \textsc{PDFgui} at \url{http://www/diffpy.org}.
\end{itemize}

Each of the program(sections) has its own users guide which include disclaimers 
and the appropriate references to cite in case you are publishing work
derived from using these programs.

This manual contains a description of the command language common to all
programs as well as detailed installation instructions. \Discus itself 
has been developing over the last nearly 30 years and the command language
was developed before anyone knew about things like python. The commands
are loosely related to FORTRAN77 syntax, so the older generation should
have no trouble with it.

\ \par
Please visit the \Discus homepage frequently at 
\url{http://tproffen.github.io/DiffuseCode/} 
and also consider subscribing 
to the \Discus mailing lists.

\section{Getting started} \label{start}

\subsection{Windows} \label{start-win}

Once the programs have been installed you should see an icon for each of 
the programs on your personal desktop. Double click the icon to start
the program of your choice.

At program start, each of the programs sets its starting folder to\\
\begin{MacVerbatim}
   C:\Users\your_name
\end{MacVerbatim}
where {\tt your\_name} will be your user name. The string {\tt Users}
may be slightly different depending on the language settings.
To work with data and macros that are stored in a separate folder, 
you need to change to this folder.

Within the DIFFUSE program window, type the command {\tt cd } including a
blank space after the {\tt cd}. At this point do not hit the enter key.
Open the desired folder with the Windows-Explorer. Left click on the 
small folder symbol in the top line that indicates the path to your
folder. This should highlight the full path to the folder. 

For \discus, \diffev, and \Mixscat you can drag this folder symbol into the
DIFFUSE program window. The command line should now read something like
\begin{MacVerbatim}
   cd C:\Users\Neder\Documents\DISCUS_examples
\end{MacVerbatim}

For \Kuplot and \suite,  select the highlighted path to the folder
with CTRL-c. Activate the \Kuplot or \Suite window and press the 
middle button on the mouse. This should place the full path into the
program window. 

Once you activate the window and hit the ENTER key the program will 
work in this folder.

\subsection{Linux} \label{start-linux}

Once you have installed the Diffuse program package, the binaries will
usually reside in the directory: {\tt /usr/local/bin/}. 
To use any of the programs, open a terminal window, switch to the
desired directory and type the program name. 

Several command line options are available for the Linux version.
The most important one is to start the execution of a macro:

\begin{MacVerbatim}
discus_suite -macro useful.mac  
discus_suite -macro useful_with_params.mac  par1 par2 par3
\end{MacVerbatim}

The first line would start \Suite and begin the automatic execution
of macro {\tt useful.mac}. Likewise in the second line, the macro
{\tt useful\_with\_params.mac} is started, which takes three parameters.
The actual strings that
you provide for <par1>, <par2>, <par3> are handed down as parameters to 
this macro. Note that there are no comma between the parameters.

For info on further command line options the the on-line help for
the Command language.

\section{Command language overview} \label{over}

All sections of the \Suite are controlled by a command language. The
basic command style is a command verb that may be accompanied by one 
or several parameters. You must type at least one empty space between
the command and the list of parameters. The parameters are all 
separated from each other by a comma as in the following short example: 

\begin{MacVerbatim}
  discus
  ! a comment
  # another comment
  read
  cell example.cell, 2,3, 4
  show atom, all   ! In line comment after exclamation mark
  exit
\end{MacVerbatim}

Anything to the right of an exclamation mark {\tt !} or a hash tag
{\tt \#} is considered a comment and is not interpreted. 

Most commands can be abbreviated, as long as the short form is
still unique. Thus these commands are all valid forms to 
step into the \Discus fourier menu:

\begin{MacVerbatim}
  fourier
  fourie
  fouri
  four
  fou
\end{MacVerbatim}


Several command throughout the \Suite take optional parameters.
Sometimes these are the last parameter(s) that you can simply
omit. See the on-line help for the individual commands for
full information.

More and more though the optional parameters are specified with the
syntax: Name of the optional parameter, a colon ":" and the actual
value you want to provide:
\begin{MacVerbatim}
 run  plot:inter, kill:yes
\end{MacVerbatim}
If an optional parameter is omitted, its value goes back to the
default value. This is a bit different compared to the
non-optional parameters. These parameters retain their value
until you change the value explicitly.

As the named optional parameters are identified by their name,
they may be given in arbitrary order.


\subsection{Help} \label{over-help}

The \Suite offers the manuals, and on-line help. To access any of the 
manuals from the \suite, type :
\begin{MacVerbatim}
  manual                 ! Opens the manual for your current section
  manual section:suite   ! Opens the SUITE manual
  manual section:discus  ! Opens the DIFFEV manual
  manual section:diffev  ! Opens the DISCUS manual
  manual section:kuplot  ! Opens the KUPLOT manual
  manual section:package ! Opens this PACKAGE manual
\end{MacVerbatim}

The \Suite will open the manual with a standard PDF viewer. Alternatively
you can open the manual with your favorite viewer with the second 
optional parameter {\tt viewer:viewer\_name}, where {\tt viewer\_name} 
shall be replaced by your favorite.

At a Linux system the manual files are usually installed into 
{\tt /usr/local/share}.

At a Windows system the manual files are in the {\tt share} folder 
within the Discus installation, commonly at
{\tt c:Program Files (x86)\textbackslash Discus\textbackslash share}.  

On-line help is available for each command through the {\tt help}
command. A straight {\tt help} will open the on-line help at the
current section respectively menu within a section. Alternatively
you can migrate immediately to the on-line help for a specific 
command by adding the command name after the help command. If 
the command is within a menu of your current section you can 
access the help by providing the menu as first parameter, followed
by the command name.

\begin{MacVerbatim}
help               ! Opens the help at the current section / menu
help fourier       ! Opens the help for the fourier command
help fourier, lots ! Opens the help for the fourier> lots command
\end{MacVerbatim}

To leave the on-line help simply hit the {\tt ENTER} key. At each 
help level the on-line help gives a list of further topics, type
any of these names to get help on one of these topics. 

The help is organized hierarchically for the menus. At the \Discus
section for example the top level provides help to all \Discus
commands. If you step into the help of (for example) the 
{\tt fourier} menu you can access the {\tt fourier} commands. 

To go back to an upper help level type {\tt ..} at the 
on-line help prompt.

As most help entries are lengthy, the list of help options at
the current level will have moved out of your view. Just type
{\tt ?} to refresh this list.

\subsection{Main commands} \label{over-main}

The main \Suite commands are summarized in table \ref{over-cmds}
followed by a list of common Unix commands.

\begin{table}[!tbh]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|p{50mm}|X|}
  \hline
  {\bf Name} &  {\bf Description} \\
  \hline\hline
  discus & Go from the main \suite level to the \Discus
           section.
           Leave this section with an "exit" command. \\
  \hline
  diffev & Go from the main \suite level to the \Diffev
           section.
           Leave this section with an "exit" command. \\
  \hline
  kuplot & Go from the main \suite level to the \Kuplot
           section. 
           Leave this section with an "exit" command. \\
  \hline
  branch <name> & Step sideway from your current section into 
           the section <name>. 
           Leave this section with an "exit" command. \\
  \hline
  exit & Leave a menu, a section or the program. If you are 
         within a menu of any of the three sections, you will
         get back to the main level of this section. If you are
         at the top level of any of the three sections, you 
         will get back to the main \Suite level. If you are at
         the main\Suite level, the program will terminate 
         without further confirmation. \\
  \hline
   help & Enter the help menu\\
  \hline
   @macro.mac & Run the commands in file "macro.mac" as if 
          they were typed interactively. See section \ref{mac}
          for full details.\\
  \hline
   learn macro.mac & Start to learn everything to type and
          log these command into the file "macro.mac". 
          This log will include everything you type, including 
          errors...\\
  \hline
   lend & Finish the learn sequence. The macro "macro.mac is 
          now available to be run as {\tt @macro.mac}\\
  \hline
   cd <folder> & Change the directory / folder to the new 
          directory / folder <folder>. 
          The path can be a 
          relative path as in {\tt cd ../new\_folder} or
          an absolute path.\\
  \hline
   system <command> & Instruct your operating system to execute
          the command <command>. As the \Suite is really a
          Unix driven program, even on a Windows computer
          these are predominantly Unix commands. Some 
          commonly used commands are listed in Table
          \ref{over-unix}\\
  \hline
   set error, <status> & The <status> may be "continue", 
          "exit" "live".\\
  \hline
   show  & Most sections and menus offer a "show" command
           to display the local settings. Check the on-line
           help at the respective menu for details.\\
  \hline
   run   & Most of the menus expect several commands that
           define the simulation / calculation prior to the
           calculation. The actual 
           calculation is carried out with the "run" command
           at the respective menu.\\
  \hline
   set prompt, <status> & The <status> may be "on", "off".\\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{over-cmds}Main \Suite commands}
\end{table}

The \Suite can react in different ways to an erroneous calculation or 
erroneous input. The default "continue" is to display an error message 
and to stop the execution of a macro/calculation. Thereafter the program 
continues with the regular interactive prompt. Sometimes one may
want to live on after a fault. This may for example occur if you test
for the existence of a file or directory/folder, or if you encounter 
the end of file upon a read. A macro can live on if the error status is
set to "live". The most stringent reaction to an error is to terminate
the  \Suite with the error status "exit". Keep in mind that no data are
saved!

During a regular interactive session the program displays a prompt like
\begin{MacVerbatim}
suite>         ! Prompt within the top level suite
discus/four>   ! Prompt within a sub menu of a section, here DISCUS
\end{MacVerbatim}
If a macro is executed, the lines that the \Suite reads from the macro
file are also echoed to the screen. This may produce lengthy output.
The choices offered are to set the prompt "on" or "off". An optional
parameter allows to save the current prompt status so that the "old" 
status can be restored at a later stage.


\begin{table}[!tbh]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|p{50mm}|X|}
  \hline
  {\bf Name} &  {\bf Description} \\
  \hline \hline
   pwd & Inquire the current directory/folder, the
          {\bf p}resent {\bf w}orking {\bf d}irectory.\\
  \hline
   ls    & List the content of the current directory/folder\\
  \hline
   mkdir <folder> & Make the new directory/folder <folder> \\
  \hline
   mkdir -p <folder> & Make the new directory/folder <folder>,
         including any intermediate parent folders. 
         This command version will not flag an error,
         if the folder does already exist. \\
  \hline
   rm <filename> & Remove the file <filename>. \\
       & Careful, this command does not ask for 
         a confirmation! \\
       & If the file does not exist
         or if it is a protected file you will get an
         error message.\\
  \hline
   rm -f <filename> & Forced remove the file <filename>. \\
       & Careful, this version does not ask for a confirmation!\\
       & This command version will not flag an error,
         if the file does not exist. \\
  \hline
   cp <from> <to> & Copies the old file <from> to a new name and
         or directory/folder <to>.\\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{over-unix}Common Unix commands}
\end{table}

Most of the Unix commands offer many more options. Just try it 
out, in many cases a parameter like "-help" 
or "--help" will give a short summary of the available options.
Examples:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{25mm}X}
ls -a & List all files, that includes hidden files\\
ls -l & List a long listing that includes many details\\
ls -R & List recursively into sub directories as well\\
\end{tabularx}

Unix offers many possibilities to work in a flexible manner with file 
names. You can place into the filename different {\it wild} characters:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{25mm}X}
* & character string of any length\\
? & exactly one character\\
\ [a-z,A-Z] & a character from interval a-z or A-Z.\\
\end{tabularx}

You may provide a single interval as well, and also a range of numbers.
Examples:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{25mm}X}
ls *.mac & List all files that end in ".mac"\\
ls data.0[0-9]1 & List all files called data.001, data.011, to data.091
files called data.002 etc. are omitted\\
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Interrupt} \label{over-inter}
If a lengthy calculation or macro appears to be faulty you can interrupt
the calculation with a {\tt CTRL-c}. The \Suite will offer a selection
how to proceed after this interrupt. You can:


\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{p{25mm}X}
{\tt resume} & the calculation. The program will (hopefully) resume
   the calculation as if nothing had happened. \\
{\tt continue} & with the normal interactive prompt. At this point
   you will be at the top level of the \Suite. Be aware that a macro
   may have changed the folder/directory. You are well advised to 
   check this with a command {\tt system pwd} \\
{\tt save} & The program will write the current crystal 
   to a file {\tt EMERGENCY.STRU} to give you a chance to recover 
   (most) of your work. It then continues in the same fashion as with the
   continue command. \\
{\tt exit} & the \Suite. \\
\end{tabularx}
