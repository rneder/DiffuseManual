#  Setup for diffev.
#  The number of population members, the number of trial children, and all
#  parameters as well as selection type and files are defined.
#
################################################################################
#
#  pop_gen[1]  = 0    The generation number is reset to zero 
#
#  pop_n[1]    = 15   We will use a population with 15 members
#  pop_c[1]    = 30   30 children are generated and their R-values calculated.
#                     Only 15 will survive into the next generation
#  pop_dimx[1] = 3    We want to refine 3 parameters
#
#  For each of the parameters we need:
#
#  pop_name    1,height  A name which will be printed into the logfile
#  pop_xmin[1] =  0.0    Lower and upper boundary. No parameter will be
#  pop_xmax[1] =200.0      outside this window.
#  pop_smin[1] =  0.0    Lower and upper start values. The initial parameters
#  pop_smax[1] =200.0      in generation zero will be within this window.
#  pop_sig [1] =  1.0    Global sigma, used is a trial parameter is outside
#                          the boundaries
#  pop_lsig[1] =  0.1    Local sigma, parameters will usually be modified by
#                          differential evolution. Alternatively you can 
#                          modify parameters locally with Gaussian distribution.
#  type real,1           A parameter may be real or integer
#  adapt sigma , 1,0.2   The global and local sigma can be adjusted while
#  adapt lsigma, 1,0.01    refining. They are set to 
#                          (largest - smallest Parameter value)*width.
#                          width is the last value on the adapt command line.
#
#  constrain p[3].ne.0.0 Logical expressions may constrain parameter values.
#
#  diff_cr[1]  = 0.8     The cross over probability is set to 0.8
#  diff_f[1]   = 0.81    The parameter difference vector is multiplied by 0.81
#  diff_k[1]   = 1.0     The donor vector is chosen along a straight line
#                          between the parent vector (diff_k[1]=0.0) and
#                          the donor base vector (diff_k[1]=1.0).
#  diff_lo[1]  = 0.3     The probability for local modification of a member
#
#  donor      random     The donor base vector is chosen randomly among the
#                          population.
#  refine     all        All parameters will be refined
#
#  selection  best,all   Selection rule, here only the pop_n[1] best members
#                        of the combined parent members and trial children 
#                        survive.
#
#  trialfile  DIFFEV/Trials     Base name for trial value files
#  restrial   DIFFEV/Result     Base name for trial result files
#  logfile    DIFFEV/Parameter  The logfile, it has SPEC format
#  summary    DIFFEV/Summary    The Summary file, also in SPEC format
